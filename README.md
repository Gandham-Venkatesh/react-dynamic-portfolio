This template includes a built-in admin dashboard to manage your portfolio content in real-time without touching the code.

To secure the dashboard, you **must** set a password as an **Environment Variable** on your deployment platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

#### How to set up your Admin Password on Netlify:

1.  **Go to your Netlify Site:**
    * Log in to Netlify and go to your site's dashboard.

2.  **Navigate to Environment Variables:**
    * Go to **Project configuration** > **Build & deploy** > **Environment**.

3.  **Add the Password Variable:**
    * Click on **"Add a variable"**.
    * For the **Key**, enter exactly: `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
    * For the **Value**, enter the secret password you want to use.
    * Click **"Create variable"**.

4.  **Redeploy:**
    * Go to the "Deploys" tab and trigger a new deploy to apply the environment variable.

Now, you can access your dashboard at `https://your-site-url.com/admin-dashboard` and log in with the password you just set.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Customize Your Portfolio

This is the fun part! All the content on the website is powered by the `src/data/portfolioData.ts` file. Just open this file and replace the placeholder data with your own.

### 1. `personalInfo`

This object holds all your personal and hero section details.

```typescript
personalInfo: {
  // Details for various sections
  name: "Your Name",
  title: "Your awesome title",
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  linkedin: "[https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile)",
  github: "[https://github.com/your-username](https://github.com/your-username)",
  
  // New fields for the Hero section
  tagline: "Your catchy tagline here.",
  loopingTexts: ["Full Stack Developer", "AI Enthusiast", "Tech Explorer"],
  
  // Profile Picture Setup
  // 1. Place your image (e.g., profile.jpg) inside the `/public` folder.

  profileImage: "/profile.jpg",

  // Other details
  about: "A detailed paragraph about you...",
  resumeLink: "Link to your resume PDF",
  // ...and so on.
},
```

### 2. `skills`

  // ... more categories
],
```

### 3. `projects`

    link: "[https://github.com/your-username/your-project](https://github.com/your-username/your-project)",
