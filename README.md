## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Customize Your Portfolio

This is the fun part! All the content on the website is powered by the `src/data/portfolioData.ts` file. Just open this file and replace the placeholder data with your own.

The main structure looks like this:

```typescript
import { PortfolioData } from '../types';

export const initialPortfolioData: PortfolioData = {
  personalInfo: { ... },
  skills: [ ... ],
  projects: [ ... ],
  internship: { ... }
};
```

Here's a breakdown of each section:

### 1. `personalInfo`

This object holds all your personal details.

```typescript
personalInfo: {
  name: "Your Name",
  title: "Your awesome title",
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  linkedin: "[https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile)",
  github: "[https://github.com/your-username](https://github.com/your-username)",
  college: "Your College Name",
  cgpa: "Your CGPA",
  about: "A detailed paragraph about you...",
  currentlyExploring: ["Tech A", "Tool B"],
  resumeLink: "Link to your resume PDF",
  professionalSummary: "A summary for your resume section..."
},
```

### 2. `skills`

This is an array of objects, where each object represents a skill category (like "Frontend", "Backend", etc.). The `level` property (0-100) controls the length of the progress bar.

```typescript
skills: [
  {
    category: "Frontend",
    skills: [
      { name: "React", level: 92 },
      { name: "HTML/CSS", level: 95 },
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Backend",
    skills: [
      { name: "Node.js", level: 87 },
      { name: "FastAPI", level: 80 },
    ]
  }
],
```

### 3. `projects`

This is an array for all your projects. The `tags` are used for the filter buttons on the projects page. Set `visible: true` to make a project appear.

```typescript
projects: [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "My Awesome Project",
    description: "A short and crisp description of your project.",
    link: "[https://github.com/your-username/your-project](https://github.com/your-username/your-project)",
    tags: ["React", "AI", "Full Stack"],
    visible: true
  }
],
```

### 4. `internship`

This object holds the details of your latest internship or work experience. The `description` is an array of strings, where each string is a bullet point.

```typescript
internship: {
  company: "Awesome Company Inc.",
  role: "Software Developer Intern",
  duration: "May 2025 ‚Äì June 2025",
  description: [
    "Built an amazing feature using Python.",
    "Created REST APIs for the main application.",
    "Collaborated with the team to deliver results."
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

Once you've customized your portfolio and pushed the code to your GitHub repository, you can easily deploy it for free on platforms like:

* **Netlify**
* **Vercel**

Both platforms usually auto-detect that it's a React/Vite project and configure the build settings for you.
